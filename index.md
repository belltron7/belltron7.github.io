# MY BLOG

Hi, I’m **Nick Bell** — this is my blog 
This is for my BYU **STAT 386** coursework, but I will also use it for projects, interests, and other statistic related things.

## What You’ll Find Here
- Walkthroughs of my coding and data-analysis projects  
- Notes from classes and tutorials  
- Occasional reflections on learning, leadership, and life

Thanks for stopping by — feel free to explore the posts or check out my [About Me](about.qmd) page to learn more!
